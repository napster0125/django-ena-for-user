  <h3>Used in production</h3>
  <p> 

  <a href="http://www.breadandpepper.com">Bread & Pepper</a> uses userena in
  their own project. Because of this we have revised a lot of the code and
  spared you of repeating this work. This has made us confident enough to be
  able to say that the the software is ready for production. Because it's open
  source, we also get feedback from the community that we use to build a solid
  product.

  <li><h3>100% test coverage</h3>
  <p>

  Account management is an important aspect of any website, therefore we
  have chosen to have 100% test coverage for every bit of code. This
  increases the confidence that we can supply a great user experience.

  Userena comes with an optional, chat-like, messaging system. Within this system
  users can see their communication with another user. It's use is intuitive and easy!

  <p>
    
    Permissions for viewing other peoples profiles are managed by
    django-guardian. This way we can let the user decide if they want to share
    their profile to everyone, registered users or nobody.
