Userina Introduction
====================

This documentation covers the first release of django-userina application. What
we have tried to do here is to make a Django application that takes care off
all your user needs by using the best web standards that are out there. Our
philosophy encombs the following. 

    User registers at your site and at successful registration gets an e-mail
    with an activation URI. The user can make use of the site for the next two
    days without activating their account. If the account is still not
    activated after two days, they get another e-mail with an activation URI
    and their account is disabled for the moment.
